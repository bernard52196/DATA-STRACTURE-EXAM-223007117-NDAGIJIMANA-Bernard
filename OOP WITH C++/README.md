Ex1:
This C++ program starts with #include<iostream>, which allows the use of input and output functions like cout. The line using namespace std; simplifies the code by eliminating the need to prefix standard functions with std::. The execution begins in the main() function, where cout<<"Hello, World!"<<endl; prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console, with endl ensuring the cursor moves to the next line. Finally, return 0; signifies that the program executed successful.
Ex2:
This C++ program demonstrates variable declaration and data types. It includes #include <iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify standard library usage. Inside main(), four variables are declared: int age = 23; for storing whole numbers, double price = 17.88; for decimal values, char grade = 'A'; for single characters, and string name = "Ange"; for text. The cout statements print these values to the console, displaying the name, age, price, and grade. Finally, return 0; signifies successful program execution.

Ex3:
This C++ program demonstrates user input handling. It includes #include <iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify code. Inside main(), two variables, string name; and int age;, are declared to store user input. The cout statements prompt the user to enter their name and age, which are captured using cin >> name; and cin >> age;. Finally, cout prints a personalized message using the input values. The program ends with return 0;, indicating successful execution.

Ex4:
This C++ program performs basic arithmetic operations. It starts with #include<iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify standard library usage. Inside main(), two integer variables, a = 20; and b = 2;, are declared. The cout statements then print the results of arithmetic operations: addition (a + b), subtraction (a - b), multiplication (a * b), division (a / b), and modulus (a % b), which gives the remainder. Finally, return 0; 

Ex5:
This C++ program demonstrates conditional statements using if-else. It starts with #include<iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify standard library usage. Inside main(), an integer variable age is initialized to 18. The if condition checks if age is 18 or greater, printing "You are adult!" if true. The else if condition checks if age is less than 17, printing "You are young". The else block handles all other cases, printing "You are mature". Finally, return 0;

EX6:
In this program, I include the iostream library to handle input and output operations. By using the standard namespace with using namespace std;, I simplify the code, avoiding the need for std:: prefixes. The main function, int main(), serves as the entry point for execution. Inside the main function, I use a for loop, for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++), to iterate from 1 to 10, printing each number with cout << "number: " << i << endl;. This outputs the current value of i followed by a newline. Finally, I include return 0; to indicate that the program has ended successfully.

Ex7:
In this program, I include the iostream library to manage input and output operations. By using the standard namespace with using namespace std;, I avoid the need for std:: prefixes, making the code simpler. The main function, int main(), serves as the starting point for the program. Within the main function, I initialize an integer variable i with the value 1. I then use a while loop, while (i <= 7), to execute the block of code as long as i is less than or equal to 7. Inside the loop, I use cout << "count: " << i << endl; to print the current value of i followed by a newline. After each iteration, I increment i by 1 with i++;. Finally, I include return 0; to indicate that the program has ended successfully


Ex:8
I use a do-while loop, which ensures that the block of code inside the loop is executed at least once. In each iteration of the loop, I use cout << "number: " << i << endl; to print the current value of i followed by a newline. After printing, I increment i by 1 with i++;. The loop continues as long as the condition i <= 5 is true.
Finally, I include return 0; to indicate that the program has ended successfully.

EX:9
In this program, I include the iostream library to manage input and output operations. By using the standard namespace with using namespace std;, I make the code simpler by avoiding the need for std:: prefixes. I define a function int add(int d, int e) that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum with the line return d + e;.
In the main function, int main(), I call the add function with the values 45 and 15, storing the result in the variable sum. I then use cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl; to print the value of sum with a descriptive message, followed by a newline. Finally, I include return 0; to indicate that the program has ended successfully. This program demonstrates a simple function that adds two numbers and prints the result.

EX10:
In this program, I include the iostream library to handle input and output operations. By using the standard namespace with using namespace std;, I make the code simpler by avoiding the need for std:: prefixes. I define a function void greet(string name) that takes a string as a parameter and prints a greeting message. The line cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl; outputs "Hello, " followed by the provided name and an exclamation mark, followed by a newline.
In the main function, int main(), I call the greet function with the argument "Mr Bernard!!", which prints the greeting message to the console. Finally, I include return 0; to indicate that the program has ended successfully. This program demonstrates a simple function that prints a personalized greeting message.
