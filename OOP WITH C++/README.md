Ex1:
This C++ program starts with #include<iostream>, which allows the use of input and output functions like cout. The line using namespace std; simplifies the code by eliminating the need to prefix standard functions with std::. The execution begins in the main() function, where cout<<"Hello, World!"<<endl; prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console, with endl ensuring the cursor moves to the next line. Finally, return 0; signifies that the program executed successful.


Ex2:
This C++ program demonstrates variable declaration and data types. It includes #include <iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify standard library usage. Inside main(), four variables are declared: int age = 23; for storing whole numbers, double price = 17.88; for decimal values, char grade = 'A'; for single characters, and string name = "Ange"; for text. The cout statements print these values to the console, displaying the name, age, price, and grade. Finally, return 0; signifies successful program execution.

Ex3:
This C++ program demonstrates user input handling. It includes #include <iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify code. Inside main(), two variables, string name; and int age;, are declared to store user input. The cout statements prompt the user to enter their name and age, which are captured using cin >> name; and cin >> age;. Finally, cout prints a personalized message using the input values. The program ends with return 0;, indicating successful execution.

Ex4:
This C++ program performs basic arithmetic operations. It starts with #include<iostream> for input-output functionality and using namespace std; to simplify standard library usage. Inside main(), two integer variables, a = 20; and b = 2;, are declared. The cout statements then print the results of arithmetic operations: addition (a + b), subtraction (a - b), multiplication (a * b), division (a / b), and modulus (a % b), which gives the remainder. Finally, return 0;
